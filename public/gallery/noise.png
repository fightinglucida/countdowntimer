# Noise Texture Placeholder

This file should contain a noise texture for Vanta.js clouds effect.

You can:
1. Download a noise texture from: https://www.vantajs.com/gallery/noise.png
2. Or create your own noise texture
3. Or comment out the texturePath in VantaBackground.tsx if you don't have one

The noise texture helps create more realistic cloud patterns.
